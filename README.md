## Introduction

delfin (Dolphin in spanish!) , the SODA Infrastructure Manager project is an an open source project to provide unified, intellect and scalable resource management with alert and performance monitoring. It will cover the resource management of all the storage backends & other infrastructures under SODA deployment and also provides the alert management and metric data(performance/health) for monitoring and further analysis. It also provides a scalable framework where multiple backends and client exporters can be added. This will enable to add more storage and infrastructure backends and also support different management clients for monitoring and health prediction.

It provides unified APIs to access, export and connect with clients as well as a set of interfaces for various driver addition.

This is one of the SODA Core Projects and is maintained by SODA Foundation directly.
